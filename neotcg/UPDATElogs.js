  unformatted logs
  if you already have logs when beginning to use this tool, or would like to archive your logs, insert the logs in the unformattedlogs variable.
  Then set what your number of crayons, current sketchpad, and completed number of sketchpads were based on those logs in UPDATEplayerinfo at the ADDING CRAYONS, CURRENT SKETCHPAD TRADES, COMPLETED SKETCHPADS section.
  
  Once you've done that, begin putting your new correctly formatted logs in the logs variable.
